## Introduction

The Face Mask Detection Using CNN Project is an AI-based system that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, wearing face masks has become an essential practice to prevent the spread of the virus. This project aims to provide a tool that can assist in monitoring and ensuring compliance with mask-wearing protocols in various settings.

## Demo

![demo](https://github.com/Hritikgoswami/Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN/assets/84679973/79b84c75-2f17-4d22-a960-9a773cc214fc)

## Features

- Detects whether a person is wearing a face mask, not wearing a face mask, or wearing it incorrectly.
- Real-time detection using webcam or video files.
- High accuracy Sequential model based on deep learning techniques.
- Easy-to-use interface for both developers and end-users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hritikgoswami/Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
